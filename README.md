# My_Vessel
My_Vessel is a modular research and simulation repository for developing, testing, and analyzing hydrodynamic models and control strategies related to marine vessels. The focus ranges from high-speed planing hull dynamics and porpoising mitigation to general trim control, added mass/damping modeling, and actuator-based stabilization (e.g., flaps, tabs, interceptors).
